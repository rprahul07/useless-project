# UNTETHERED ðŸŽ¯

## Basic Details
**Team Name:** Individual
**Team Members:**  
- **Team Lead:** Rahul R P - CUSAT  


## Project Description
UNTETHERED is a decentralized application (dApp) designed to empower volunteers globally through blockchain, incentivizing them for their contributions toward tackling global issues aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Volunteers around the world struggle with a **massive lack of recognition**, **unbelievably complex resource allocation**, **opacity so dense you can't see through it**, and a **mind-blowing shortage of gamified engagement**.

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)
With UNTETHERED, weâ€™re providing Ethereum tokens as if everyone were asking for them! Weâ€™re throwing in gamification, transparent tracking, and community-driven governance because everyone loves having tokens for fixing the world!
